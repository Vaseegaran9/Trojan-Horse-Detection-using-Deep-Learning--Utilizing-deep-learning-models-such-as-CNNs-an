# Trojan-Horse-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-
Utilizing deep learning models such as CNNs and RNNs can enhance the precision and resilience of trojan detection. Assessing these models with a varied set of real-world data features can confirm their efficacy.

Step 1: Preparing the Data
-Load the Trojan detection dataset using the pandas library.
-Clean the data by handling missing or irrelevant information, and remove any duplicates.
-Convert categorical features to numerical form using label encoding.
-Change the class labels ("Trojan" and "Benign") into numbers (1 and 0).
-Select the most informative features using mutual information.

Step 2: Splitting the Data
-Split the preprocessed data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

Step 3: Applying Machine Learning Techniques

1)Random Forest:
Train a Random Forest Classifier with 50 estimators and check its accuracy on the test set.
Experiment with different numbers of estimators to find the best setup.

2)AdaBoost:
Train an AdaBoost Classifier with, for example, 100 estimators and assess its accuracy on the test set.

3)Gaussian Naive Bayes:
Train a Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier and use cross-validation to estimate the models' performance more robustly.

Step 4: Applying Deep Learning with a Feedforward Neural Network

Install required libraries like TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and pandas if not already installed.
Standardize the input data using StandardScaler for the neural network.
Define a feedforward neural network with suitable activation functions and layers.
Compile and train the neural network on the preprocessed data for a specified number of epochs.

Step 5: Hybrid model (StackingClassifier with RandomForestClassifier and GradientBoostingClassifier as base models, and LogisticRegression as the meta-model)
-Data Preprocessing for Neural Network:
-Standardize the input data using StandardScaler.
-Define the base-model, meta-model, creating stacking classifier
-Train the model on the preprocessed data, making prediction and calculating the accuracy.

Step 6: Hybrid model (Voting Classifier with a combination of  RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier and SVC)
-Data Preprocessing for Neural Network:
-Standardize the input data.
-Define the base-model,creating voting classifier
-Train the model on the preprocessed data, making prediction and calculating the accuracy.
